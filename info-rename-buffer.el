;;; Commentary:

;; ‘info-rename-buffer-mode’ is a global minor-mode that automatically
;; renames Info buffers to match their visiting manual.

;; That’s a useful feature when consulting several Info manuals
;; simultaneously, because it frees the user from the burden of
;; renaming Info buffers to descriptive names manually before visiting
;; another manual, thus avoiding accidentally overriding the currently
;; visited node in case the user tries to open a new Info buffer.

;;; Code:


(require 'info)


;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode info-rename-buffer-mode
  "Toggle Info-Rename-Buffer mode on or off.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Info-Rename-Buffer mode if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is
‘toggle’.

When Info-Rename-Buffer is enabled, Info buffer's name is
automatically changed to include its currently visiting manual's
name.  See the command \\[info-rename-buffer]."
  :group 'info
  :init-value nil
  :global t
  :require 'info-rename-buffer
  (if info-rename-buffer-mode
      (add-hook 'Info-selection-hook #'info-rename-buffer)
    (remove-hook 'Info-selection-hook #'info-rename-buffer)))


(defun info-rename-buffer ()
  "Rename current Info buffer to match its visiting manual."
  (interactive)
  (unless (ignore-errors
	    (rename-buffer
	     (format "*info %s*" (file-name-base Info-current-file))
	     'unique))
    (user-error "%s" "This is not an Info buffer.")))
